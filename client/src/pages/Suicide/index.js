          You are enough. You matter. Your life is worth fighting for. Suicide
          is a leading cause of death. It’s also preventable. In U.S. alone, we
          have the ability to save nearly 45,000 lives every year. Globally,
          that number is closer to 800,000. But, hold up. Before we get to
          saving the world, let’s check-in. If you’re feeling like ending your
          life, you can always ask for help managing your emotions. Asking for
          help is brave. You are brave. You are valuable! You are important!
          And, the world needs you. Please share your gifts with the world,
          little bee.

              Confiding in someone can help you build a support system for times
              when you are feeling in a really dark place. Nervous about
              reaching out? Start with a text message like this: “Hey there. I’m
              feeling really alone right now. Would you mind keeping me
              company?”

              Distract yourself. Find even one thing that brings you joy. And,

              (listening to music is one of the most common coping tools for our
              texters), or maybe it’s looking into the eyes of your adorable
              pup. Whatever it may be, find one thing to turn to when you feel
              in the darkest of places.

              Something that has helped me tremendously is putting my hands over
