          How ironic! You are worthy just because you exist. There's nothing you need to do
          or be to prove yourself. You are worthy beyond belief simply because
          you're here.

          It's hard to understand, but you matter so much that everything you do
          and think has a direct effect in the entire world. If you don't like what you
          see when you look around, change it or create something else. Go play, little bee,
          and co-create with the humans.
