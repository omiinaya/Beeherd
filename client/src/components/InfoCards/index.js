          How ironic! You are worthy just because you exist. There's nothing you need to do
          or be to prove yourself. You are worthy beyond belief simply because
          you're here.

          You matter so much that everything you do
          and think has a direct effect on the entire world. You are a master creator made of energy and frequency. Go play, little bee,
          and co-create with the humans.
